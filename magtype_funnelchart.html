                It is based on the maximum amplitude of a seismogram recorded on a Wood-Anderson torsion seismograph.
                Although these instruments are no longer widely in use, ML values are calculated using modern instrumentation with appropriate adjustments.
                Reported by NEIC for all earthquakes in the US and Canada. Only authoritative for smaller events,
                typically Magnitudes greater than 4.0 for which there is no mb or moment magnitude.
                In the central and eastern United States, NEIC also computes ML, but restricts the distance range to 0-150 km.
